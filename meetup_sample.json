Many of the previous committee members from last year’s walk will be rejoining and leading the same subcommittees but we still need help.<\/p> \n<p>If you have always wondered what it feels like to help plan, organize and execute a walk\/event, this is a great opportunity to see all the effort that it takes to make it happen while feeling the reward for accomplishing something for a good cause. No experience is required and if you feel unsure, others who have organized past walks will be there to help guide you. If you don’t feel like committing to organizing the walk but feel like you can help out on occasion, the AFSP needs volunteers to help with resource tabling at various mental health resource fairs and events. When you table, you are raising awareness and disseminating information about the AFSP and its mission. Such events include NAMI WALKS, LGBTQ EVENTS (PRIDE, LET’S GET BETTER TOGETHER), TUCSON PALOOZA and many resource fairs\/events in support of mental health throughout the year.<\/p> \n<p>Again, no experience is necessary and it’s quick to learn. If you or someone you know might be interested in joining the AFSP family, please message me for more details. Committee meetings will start in July.<\/p> \n<p>On behalf of the AFSP, we appreciate the community's support!<\/p>","mtime":1494726659363,"event_url":"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/freethoughtaz\/events\/239969185\/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"payment_required":"0","name":"Join the 'Out of the Darkness' Walk Committee","id":"239969185","group":{"join_mode":"open","country":"us","city":"Tucson","name":"Freethought Arizona","group_lon":-110.95,"id":1487478,"state":"AZ","urlname":"freethoughtaz","category":{"name":"religion\/beliefs","id":28,"shortname":"religion-beliefs"},"group_photo":{"highres_link":"https:\/\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/f\/3\/highres_446724819.jpeg","photo_link":"https:\/\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/f\/3\/600_446724819.jpeg","photo_id":446724819,"thumb_link":"https:\/\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/0\/f\/3\/thumb_446724819.jpeg"},"group_lat":32.24},"status":"proposed"}
